While there is more input 
take and record first number
move to first operator, if it is multiplication or division, pop it and push the answer
else if the operator is + or - move on, if there is any other input. If there is no other input pop the equation and push out the answer.  
For any stars or slashes (multiplication/division) pop that part of the equation and push out the answer to reduce the equation
Once all stars/slashes are popped out, evaluate for addition and subtraction
pop out all plus and minus signs, and push out the answer till you get one final number
The final number is your answer
